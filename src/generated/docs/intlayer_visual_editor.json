Once a change is made, the content will be replaced in the code-base. That means that the application will be rebuilt and the page will be reloaded to display the new content.\n\nIn contrast, the [Intlayer CMS](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/intlayer_CMS.md) is a tool that allows you to manage your content in a visual editor for distant dictionaries. Once a change is made, the content will **not** impact your code-base. And the website will automatically display the changed content.\n\n## Integrate Intlayer into your application\n\nFor more details on how to integrate intlayer, see the relevant section below:\n\n### Integrating with Next.js\n\nFor integration with Next.js, refer to the [setup guide](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/intlayer_with_nextjs_15.md).\n\n### Integrating with Create React App\n\nFor integration with Create React App, refer to the [setup guide](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/intlayer_with_create_react_app.md).\n\n### Integrating with Vite + React\n\nFor integration with Vite + React, refer to the [setup guide](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/intlayer_with_vite+react.md).\n\n## How Intlayer Editor Works\n\nThe visual editor in an application that includes two things:\n\n- A frontend application that will display your website into a iframe. If your website uses Intlayer, the visual editor will automatically detect your content, and will allow you to interact with it. Once a modification is made, you will be able to download your changes.\n\n- Once you clicked the download button, the visual editor will send a request to the server to replace your content declaration files with the new content (wherever these files are declared in your project).\n\n> Note that Intlayer Editor will write your content declaration files as JSON if the file extension is `.json`. If the file extension is `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, it will write the file as a JavaScript file using a babel transformer.\n\n## Installation\n\nOnce Intlayer is configured in your project, simply install `intlayer-editor` as a development dependency:\n\n```bash packageManager=\"npm\"\nnpm install intlayer-editor --save-dev\n```\n\n```bash packageManager=\"yarn\"\nyarn add intlayer-editor --save-dev\n```\n\n```bash packageManager=\"pnpm\"\npnpm add intlayer-editor --save-dev\n```\n\n```bash packageManager=\"bun\"\nbun add intlayer-editor --dev\n```\n\nWith the `--with` flag, you can start the editor in parallel with another command:\n\n```json5 fileName=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start:editor\": \"npx intlayer-editor start --with 'next dev --turbopack'\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn your Intlayer configuration file, you can customize the editor settings:\n\n```typescript fileName=\"intlayer.config.ts\" codeFormat=\"typescript\"\nimport type { IntlayerConfig } from \"intlayer\";\n\nconst config: IntlayerConfig = {\n  // ... other configuration settings\n  editor: {\n    /**\n     * Required\n     * The URL of the application.\n     * This is the URL targeted by the visual editor.\n     * Example: 'http://localhost:3000'\n     */\n    applicationURL: process.env.INTLAYER_APPLICATION_URL,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as `true`. If `false`, the editor is inactive and cannot be accessed.\n     * Can be used to disable the editor for specific environments for security reason, such as production.\n     */\n    enabled: process.env.INTLAYER_ENABLED,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as `8000`.\n     * The port of the editor server.\n     */\n    port: process.env.INTLAYER_PORT,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as \"http://localhost:8000\"\n     * The URL of the editor server.\n     */\n    editorURL: process.env.INTLAYER_EDITOR_URL,\n  },\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n```javascript fileName=\"intlayer.config.mjs\" codeFormat=\"esm\"\n/** @type {import('intlayer').IntlayerConfig} */\nconst config = {\n  // ... other configuration settings\n  editor: {\n    /**\n     * Required\n     * The URL of the application.\n     * This is the URL targeted by the visual editor.\n     * Example: 'http://localhost:3000'\n     */\n    applicationURL: process.env.INTLAYER_APPLICATION_URL,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as `true`. If `false`, the editor is inactive and cannot be accessed.\n     * Can be used to disable the editor for specific environments for security reason, such as production.\n     */\n    enabled: process.env.INTLAYER_ENABLED,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as `8000`.\n     * The port used by the visual editor server.\n     */\n    port: process.env.INTLAYER_PORT,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as \"http://localhost:8000\"\n     * The URL of the editor server to reach from the application. Used to restrict the origins that can interact with the application for security reasons. If set to `'*'`, the editor is accessible from any origin. Should be set if port is changed, or if the editor is hosted on a different domain.\n     */\n    editorURL: process.env.INTLAYER_EDITOR_URL,\n  },\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n```javascript fileName=\"intlayer.config.cjs\" codeFormat=\"commonjs\"\n/** @type {import('intlayer').IntlayerConfig} */\nconst config = {\n  // ... other configuration settings\n  editor: {\n    /**\n     * Required\n     * The URL of the application.\n     * This is the URL targeted by the visual editor.\n     */\n    applicationURL: process.env.INTLAYER_APPLICATION_URL,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as `8000`.\n     * The port of the editor server.\n     */\n    port: process.env.INTLAYER_PORT,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as \"http://localhost:8000\"\n     * The URL of the editor server.\n     */\n    editorURL: process.env.INTLAYER_EDITOR_URL,\n    /**\n     * Optional\n     * Default as `true`. If `false`, the editor is inactive and cannot be accessed.\n     * Can be used to disable the editor for specific environments for security reason, such as production.\n     */\n    enabled: process.env.INTLAYER_ENABLED,\n  },\n};\n\nmodule.exports = config;\n```\n\n> To see all available parameters, refer to the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/configuration.md).\n\n## Using the Editor\n\n1. When the editor is installed, you can start the editor using the following command:\n\n   ```bash packageManager=\"npm\"\n   npx intlayer-editor start\n   ```\n\n   ```bash packageManager=\"yarn\"\n   yarn intlayer-editor start\n   ```\n\n   ```bash packageManager=\"pnpm\"\n   pnpm intlayer-editor start\n   ```\n\n   > **Note that you should run your application in parallel.** The application URL should match the one you set in the editor configuration (`applicationURL`).\n\n   > **Note the command is reexported by the `intlayer` package. You can use `npx intlayer editor start` instead.**\n\n2. Then, open the URL provided. By default `http://localhost:8000`.\n\n   You can view each field indexed by Intlayer by hovering over your content with your cursor.\n\n   ![Hovering over content](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/assets/intlayer_editor_hover_content.png)\n\n3. If your content is outlined, you can long-press it to display the edit drawer.\n\n## Environment configuration\n\nThe editor can be configured to use a specific environment file. This is useful when you want to use the same configuration file for development and production.\n\nTo use a specific environment file, you can use the `--env-file` or `-f` flag when starting the editor:\n\n```bash packageManager=\"npm\"\nnpx intlayer-editor start -f .env.development\n```\n\n```bash packageManager=\"yarn\"\nyarn intlayer-editor start -f .env.development\n```\n\n```bash packageManager=\"pnpm\"\npnpm intlayer-editor start -f .env.development\n```\n\n> Note that the environment file should be located in the root directory of your project.\n\nOr you can use the `--env` or `-e` flag to specify the environment:\n\n```bash packageManager=\"npm\"\nnpx intlayer-editor start -e development\n```\n\n```bash packageManager=\"yarn\"\nyarn intlayer-editor start -e development\n```\n\n```bash packageManager=\"pnpm\"\npnpm intlayer-editor start -e development\n```\n\n## Debug\n\nIf you encounter any issues with the visual editor, check the following:\n\n- The visual editor and the application are running.\n\n- The [`editor`](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/configuration#editor-configuration) configuration are correctly set in your Intlayer configuration file.\n  - Required fields:\n    - The application URL should match the one you set in the editor configuration (`applicationURL`).\n\n- The visual editor use an iframe to display your website. Ensure that the Content Security Policy (CSP) of your website allows the CMS url as `frame-ancestors` ('http://localhost:8000' by default). Check the editor console for any error.\n",
