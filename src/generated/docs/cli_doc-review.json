However, the review process will optimize the chunks to review, and will skip the parts that are not changed.\n\n## Arguments:\n\nThe `doc review` command accepts the same arguments as `doc translate`, allowing you to review specific documentation files and apply quality checks.\n\nIf you activated one of the git options, the command will only review the part of the files that getting changed. The script will process by chunking the file and review each chunk. If there is no changes in the chunk, the script will skip it to speed up the review process and limit the AI Provider API cost.\n\nFor a complete list of arguments, see the [Translate Document](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/cli/doc-translate.md) command documentation.\n",
