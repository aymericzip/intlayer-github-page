It offers powerful features such as centralized or distributed content declaration, extensive internationalization options, Markdown support, conditional rendering, TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON integration, and more. Below is a comprehensive overview of what Intlayer currently provides, followed by upcoming roadmap features.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<TOC/>\n\n---\n\n## Current Features\n\n### 1. Content Declaration\n\n#### Centralized or Distributed\n\n- **Centralized**: Declare all your content in a single, large file at the base of your application, similar to i18next, so you can manage everything in one place.\n- **Distributed**: Alternatively, split your content into separate files at the component or feature level for better maintainability. This keeps your content close to the relevant code (components, tests, Storybook, etc.). Removing a component ensures any associated content is also removed, preventing leftover data from cluttering your codebase.\n\n> Resources:\n>\n> - [Content Declaration](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/dictionary/content_file.md)\n\n### 2. Internationalization\n\n- Support for **230 languages and locales** (including regional variants like French (France), English (Canada), English (UK), Portuguese (Portugal), etc.).\n- Easily manage translations for all these locales from one place.\n\n> Resources:\n>\n> - [Internationalization](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/dictionary/translation.md)\n\n### 3. Markdown Support\n\n- Declare content using **Markdown**, allowing you to automatically format text with paragraphs, headings, links, and more.\n- Ideal for blog posts, articles, documentation pages, or any scenario where rich text formatting is needed.\n\n> Resources:\n>\n> - [Markdown](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/dictionary/markdown.md)\n\n### 4. External file support\n\n- Import content from external files as text format, such as TXT, HTML, JSON, YAML, or CSV.\n- Use the `file` function in Intlayer to embed external file content into a dictionary, ensuring seamless integration with the Intlayer Visual Editor and CMS.\n- Supports dynamic content updates, meaning that when the source file is modified, the content updates automatically within Intlayer.\n- Enables multilingual content management by linking language-specific Markdown files dynamically.\n\n> Resources:\n>\n> - [File Content Embedding](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/dictionary/file.md)\n\n### 5. Dynamic Content & Function Fetching\n\nIntlayer provides various methods to insert and manage dynamic content, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in content delivery. This includes functions for dynamic content insertion, conditional rendering, enumeration, nesting, and function fetching.\n\n1. Dynamic Content Insertion\n\n   Use the insert function to define content with placeholders ({{name}}, {{age}}, etc.).\n\n   Enables template-like content that adapts based on user input, API responses, or other dynamic data sources.\n\n   Works seamlessly with TypeScript, ESM, CommonJS, and JSON configurations.\n\n   Easily integrates with React Intlayer and Next Intlayer using useIntlayer.\n\n2. Conditional Rendering\n\n   Define content that adapts based on user-specific conditions, such as language or authentication status.\n\n   Tailor personalized experiences without duplicating content across multiple files.\n\n3. Enumeration & Pluralization\n\n   Use the enu function to define content variations based on numeric values, ranges, or custom keys.\n\n   Ensures automatic selection of the correct phrase based on a given value.\n\n   Supports ordering rules, ensuring predictable behavior.\n\n4. Nesting & Sub-Content Referencing\n\n   Use the nest function to reference and reuse content from another dictionary, reducing duplication.\n\n   Supports structured and hierarchical content management for better maintainability.\n\n5. Function Fetching\n\n   Intlayer allows content to be declared as functions, enabling both synchronous and asynchronous content retrieval.\n\n   Synchronous Functions: Content is generated dynamically at build time.\n\n   Asynchronous Functions: Fetch data from external sources (e.g., APIs, databases) dynamically.\n\n   Integration: Works with TypeScript, ESM, and CommonJS but is not supported in JSON or remote content files.\n\n### 6. Content Declaration Formats\n\nIntlayer supports **TypeScript** (also JavaScript) and **JSON** for declaring content.\n\n- **TypeScript**:\n  - Ensures your content structure is correct and that no translations are missing.\n  - Offers strict or more flexible validation modes.\n  - Allows dynamic data fetching from variables, functions, or external APIs.\n\n- **JSON**:\n  - Makes it easy to integrate with external tools (like visual editors) due to its standardized format.\n\n  > Resources:\n  >\n  > - [Content Declaration Formats](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/dictionary/content_file.md)\n\n### 7. Purging, bundle optimization and dynamic imports\n\n- Intlayer integrates `Babel` and `SWC` plugins to optimize your bundle and improve performance. It replace imports, to allows importing only the dictionaries that are used into the bundle.\n- By activating the option, Intlayer also allows to import dynamically the dictionary content for the current locale only.\n\n> Resources:\n>\n> - [Build Configuration](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/configuration#build-configuration)\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Frameworks & Environments\n\n### 1.
