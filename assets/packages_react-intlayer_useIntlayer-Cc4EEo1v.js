# useIntlayer Hook Documentation

The \`useIntlayer\` hook allows you to retrieve localized content from a dictionary using its key. It is based on \`useDictionary\` but automatically injects an optimized version of the dictionary from the generated declarations.

## Usage

\`\`\`tsx
import { useIntlayer } from "react-intlayer";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const content = useIntlayer("my_dictionary_key");

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{content.title}</h1>
      <p>{content.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
\`\`\`

## Description

The hook performing the following tasks:

1. **Locale Detection**: It uses the current locale from the \`IntlayerProvider\` context.
2. **Dictionary Injection**: it automatically injects the content of the dictionary corresponding to the provided key, using the optimized declarations generated by the Intlayer compiler.
3. **Translation Processing**: it resolves the content based on the detected locale, processing any \`t()\`, \`enu()\`, etc., definitions found within the dictionary.
